# TorQ Crypto

![Aquaq Logo](graphics/logoaquaq.PNG)

TorQ Crypto provides an example of how an application can be built and 
deployed on top of the TorQ framework. This framework behaves in a similar 
manner to the Finance Starter Pack with the main difference being that 
TorQ Crypto collects and stores real data. To avoid duplicated documentation 
TorQ and the Finance Starter pack are linked below:

- [TorQ Manual](https://aquaqanalytics.github.io/TorQ/)
- [Finance Starter Pack](https://aquaqanalytics.github.io/TorQ-Finance-Starter-Pack/)

TorQ Crypto includes:

- Collection of real time level 2 order book data 
- Full configurable subscription to 5 Cryptocurrency exchanges
- Custom API functions for data analysis 

Once started, TorQ will collect Cryptocurrency and and push it into an 
in-memory real-time database. It will persist this data to disk every 
day at midnight. The system will operate 24*7 and is highly customisable.
